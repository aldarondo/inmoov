# Summary

Many Thanks to- Mr Gael- for sharing his work-

This is Re-Mix of the Inmoov Head for BigBed Printers -- (230mm x 150mm Min ?)
More Updated Photos will be uploaded soon,,,,(some photos are from v2 version)

There is a fair bit of Mod work done to Interior mechanical parts but the overall design remains the same, the exterior Skull is as close to the original as could make it,, 

So basically all the smaller parts where aligned then hand stitched together the largest error in the exterior Skull was less then 1mm,,, there has been Mod work on the interior Skull and the jaw has been scaled a little bit to mach the curves of his face a bit better- 

All parts have been printed and tested,,, they are in there printing position and are error free,,, the use of Support material will be need for some of the parts,,,

The Gear Ratios are the same as the original inmoov and i have kept it as Backward Compatible as much as possible,,,,

The Eyes and Ears are not included- download the originals from the inmoov website or use the modded ones that are in with my other designs-- the ears will have to be downloaded from the inmoov website--

The Skull is not a easy print,,, i strongly recommend you try different slice setting to find the best one that matches your printer-- even do some test prints at half-scale will give you good idea on what setting you will need to use,,

Sketch-Up Files are included- so you Modify the parts to suit you own design

*Note --"Square M3 Nuts are used--"- Cheap ones, not the Stainless steel ones which are slightly bigger (but they can be squeezed in )
"
Mine is "0.3mm layer height" and "0.5 mm Default extrusion width " but this will Change for the final print,,,
100% infill for the low skull - around 2 perimeters
50% infill for the top Skull-  around 8 perimeters,, or enough perimeters so that only perimeter lines can be seen,,

i do not recommend this project for beginners ,,,,,,,

Once again Many Thanks to "Mr Gael" Inmoovs Designer --
