# Summary

Many Thanks to -Mr Gael-  Inmoov Project Designer

These are Inmoov's Chest Plates that have been re-joined to make larger pieces for larger printers,, the pictures tell the story,,, there- 1pc / 2pc / 4pc Versions and a picture of the original pieces the overall design has not been modified and is backwards compatible with all original parts-

There is a modded Neck and Neck Joiner that uses bolts to join it the body the neck is for the 3-point drive system designed by "Bob Huston" there was some mod work done on the bottom section of the Neck for a cleaner mating surface between the neck and chest plate and bolts to be inserted- The main reason for adding bolts is for PLA printing where Gluing is a problem,,
This Re-Mix was a bitch to do- but was worth effort, ,,Chest plats are 10mm Thick 

There’s a "Test Joiner" piece for the testing out the “Dove Tail " joins before printing the large pieces- you can use this to test out glues or practice file work or thermal welding with a rotary tool or etc..,,,i made it a tight fit on purpose so bonding with Acetone/glues produce a nice clean joint,,,

SketchUp File is Included

Hardware for Neck

2 x 25mm M3 Bolts
6 x Square M3 Nuts

( I haven't put this in as a Re-Mix because theirs no Chest File on Thingiverse _
