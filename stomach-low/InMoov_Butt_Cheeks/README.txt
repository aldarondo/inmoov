# Summary

Behold, InMoov's glorius buttcheeks!



Print Guide:

Place the butt cheeks with the two voids on the print bed. I placed custom supports inside the voids but didn't put any outside of those. You may need supports for the overhanging part of the cheek.

The Pole Connector is to help align with the parts above.

The Butt Attach can be glued (or use self-tap screws) into the top of the butt and is then screwed into the fixings where your stomach rotation servos screw in.

The Thigh Holder Allows the connection of a bolt through the current InMoov thigh.

These butt cheeks should be compatible with the current Non-Motorized InMoov legs.
(they work for mine).

The greater the infill, the stronger the butt. I did 30%
